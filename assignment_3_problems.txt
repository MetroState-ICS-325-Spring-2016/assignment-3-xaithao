You will need to import the classicmodels database from mysqlsampledatabase.sql
using MySQL workbench before you start working on this assignment.

For the questions, put your SQL query first and your output second.
For example,
Question:
How many customers have a credit limit over $20,000?

Answer:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `customers` WHERE `creditLimit` > 20000;
97

Answer:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `customers` WHERE `country` = 'Germany';
13

2. What is the contact first name and contact last name for every contact that has a first name that starts with D?
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE contactFirstName LIKE 'D%';
Diego Freyre
Dean Cassidy
Daniel Da Silva
Daniel Tonini
Dorothy Young
Dominique Perrier
Dan Lewis

3. What are the customer names for every company that Leslie Thompson is a sales rep for?
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE salesRepEmployeeNumber LIKE '1166';
Signal Gift Stores
Toys4GrownUps.com
Boards & Toys Co.
Collectible Mini Designs Co.
Men 'R' US Retailers, Ltd.
West Coast Collectables Co.

4. What was the amount for the last payment that Boards & Toys Co. made? (Should return only 1 field with the amount.)
SELECT amount FROM `payments` WHERE `customerNumber` LIKE '219' ORDER BY paymentDate DESC LIMIT 1;
3452.75

5. How many payments have been made that are more than 20000? (Should return 1 field with the count.)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `payments` WHERE `amount` > 20000;
195

6. Write a PHP program that prints the following information to the terminal:
The customer name, country, and sales rep name on one line per customer.
Order the results by country first and customer name second.
See assignment_3_solution_output.txt for what the output should look like.
assignment_3.php contains most of the code you need to complete the assignment.
You will need to write the SQL query and write the output.
You should use only 1 SQL query to the database.

SQL query
SELECT `country`, `customerName`, `firstName`, `lastName` FROM `customers` INNER JOIN `employees` ON `customers`.`salesRepEmployeeNumber`=`employees`.`employeeNumber`ORDER BY `country`, `firstName`;

Problems 1 through 5 are worth 10 points each.
Problem 6 is worth 40 points.
The total number of points for the assignment is 90.

Point breakdown for problem 6:
10 points - 1 SQL query
10 points - correct output format (see assignment_3_solution_output.txt)
 5 points - correct data from the customers table
 5 points - correct data from the employees table
 5 points - order by country first
 5 points - order by customer name second
